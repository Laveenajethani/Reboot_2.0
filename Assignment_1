Problem #1 Block System call :
    block system call for date command
    that means you don't have to uninstall date command but if you run kernel must not accept
    do the same Firefox as well

Solution-->
I removed execution permission from date and firefox command by using :
After this on running these command we get a message that permission denied.

    sudo chmod  -x  /usr/bin/date
    sudo chmod  -x /usr/bin/firefox

But if someone wants no response not even a denial message then we have to uncomment following command
    MOZ_DISABLE_LANGPACKS=1

Problem #2 :  play with directory 
  create a directory without name from command line
  create a directory with name "-okgoogle"
 
Solution-->
  for creating a directory without name i used:
      mkdir ''$'\n'
  But if you try to make a directory with name -okgoogle it will not create a directory for you, because in linux -o is a flag which is used to denote the name of output file.
  so for creating a file with such name you have to gve the full path where you want to create this directory.
      mkdir ./-okgoogle
