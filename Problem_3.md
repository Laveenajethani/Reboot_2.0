### solution
  - we can create nested folder using command `mkdir -p A/B/C`
  - for creating multiple folder in single folder `mkdir -p A/{B,C}`
  - for creating single folder in multiple folders `mkdir -p {A,B}/C`
  - Reboot.txt is shared by all directories so any change in this directory will reflect everywhere.
  - solution is in below image
