Problem #4.  share and files and folder 


 create two users name jack and Jill  from command line
create all the data under home directory of each users 
login with jack user and create a file name  jack.txt using vim editor and write "hello jack"
from jack user also create two directories name jack1 & jack2 
now login from Jill user and create a file. Jill.txt using vim editor and write "hey jiil"
from Jill also create two directoires named jill1 & jill2 

Important :  swap these files and directories in between users  and to swap don't use root account.

            inside Jack user --> mkdir jack1 jack2
                                 vim jack.txt < hello jack  exit the editor using "Esc" :wq
        3.  login as Jill
            inside Jill user --> mkdir jill1 jill2
                                 vim jill.txt < hey jill exit the editor using "Esc" :wq
