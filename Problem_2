Problem #2 :  play with directory 
  create a directory without name from command line
  create a directory with name "-okgoogle"
 
Solution-->
  for creating a directory without name i used:
      mkdir ''$'\n'
  
  But if you try to make a directory with name -okgoogle it will not create a directory for you, because in linux -o is a flag which is used to denote the name of output file.
  so for creating a file with such name you have to gve the full path where you want to create this directory.
     
     
     mkdir ./-okgoogle
