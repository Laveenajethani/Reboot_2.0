we can create nested folder using command
mkdir -p A/B/C

for creating multiple folder in single folder
mkdir -p A/{B,C}

for creating single folder in multiple folders 
mkdir -p {A,B}/C

Problem_3 -->Create a directory structure using single command
  solution-->
          mkdir -p A/{B/{G/K,H/J},C/{I/J,J/L},D/{F/L,E/M}}/Reboot.txt
          
          
 Reboot.txt is shared by all directories so any change in this directory will reflect everywhere.
