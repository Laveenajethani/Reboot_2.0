Problem #1 Block System call :
    block system call for date command
    that means you don't have to uninstall date command but if you run kernel must not accept
    do the same Firefox as well

Solution-->
I removed execution permission from date and firefox command by using :
After this on running these command we get a message that permission denied.

    sudo chmod  -x  /usr/bin/date
    sudo chmod  -x /usr/bin/firefox

But if someone wants no response not even a denial message then we have to uncomment following command
    MOZ_DISABLE_LANGPACKS=1
